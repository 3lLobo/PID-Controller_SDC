# PID Controller - Self Driving Car Nanodegree## Intro PID ControllerA PID controller will be used in this project to steer a car on a racing track. It consists of three different components, the P, the I and the D part.###P ControllerThe proportional part of the controller uses the following equation:>>>      steer = -taup * cteThis control by itself drives the car in the direction of the path. Problems are overshooting.###PD ControllerTo avoid overshooting the derivative is used. The following equation is used:>>>      diff_cte =  cte- prev_cte      prev_cte =  cte      steer = -tau_p *  cte - tau_d * diff_cte###PID ControllerThere are situations left, which the PD Controller cant handle, like an initial offset. Therefore the integration part need sto be taken in account. The following equation shows the final controller:>>>        diff_cte = cte - prev_cte        prev_cte = cte        int_cte += cte        steer = -tau_p * cte - tau_d * diff_cte - tau_i * int_cte##Tuning the tau parametersThe parameters have been chosen as follows: for P and D relatively large to make them dominant and a small value for I to avoid oscillation.The parameters have been tunes manually. The twiddle algorithm can obtain better results in optimization
